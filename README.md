# Shubhankar Agrawal

This project is my personal website available at [http://astronights.github.io](http://astronights.github.io). It serves as a web rendition of a more detailed version of my CV along with stylized components using ML based data visualizations.

## Technology

The project is built primarily on React with Typescript as the framework to develop the application. A majority of the UI components were created using CHakra UI with reliance on other libraries for interactive visualizations of Neural Networks and Knowledge Graphs.
