## About

ðŸ“ˆ With a passion for solving complex puzzles and crunching numbers, I'm your go-to data wizard. From driving revenue optimization at financial institutions to crafting innovative data-driven strategies, I've charted a path through the expansive realm of data science.

ðŸš€ My professional journey includes roles at OCBC, where I elevated earnings with machine learning solutions, and at JP Morgan Chase, where I introduced data science to optimize workflows. I've demonstrated my expertise in deciphering data challenges and driving actionable insights.

ðŸŽ“ Equipped with a Master's in Artificial Intelligence and a Bachelor's in Computer Science (with a dash of Finance and French), I've earned several accolades, including university scholarships and Dean's Honour Lists.

ðŸ¤– When I'm not diving into data, you'll find me exploring the realms of trivia, linguistics, art history, puzzles, and strumming some tunes on my ukulele.
