## About
Hello, I'm Shubhankar Agrawal!

Data Scientist | Problem Solver | AI Enthusiast

ðŸŒŸ Turning Data into Insights, and Insights into Impact! ðŸŒŸ

ðŸ“ˆ With a passion for crunching numbers and a knack for solving complex puzzles, I'm your go-to data wizard. From driving revenue optimization at esteemed financial institutions to crafting innovative data-driven strategies, I've charted a path through the expansive realm of data science.

ðŸš€ My professional journey includes roles at OCBC, where I elevated earnings to new heights, and at JP Morgan Chase, where I seamlessly blended data science with creative problem-solving. I've demonstrated my expertise in deciphering complex data challenges and driving actionable insights.

ðŸŽ“ Equipped with a Master's in Artificial Intelligence and a Bachelor's in Computer Science (with a dash of Finance and French), I've earned accolades, including the prestigious OCBC AI Scholarship.

ðŸ¤– When I'm not diving into data, you'll find me exploring the realms of trivia, linguistics, art history, and strumming some tunes on my ukulele. I'm not just about data; I'm all about balance!

Let's explore the world of data and creativity together. Feel free to connect with me, and together, we can weave magic!
