## About

ðŸ“ˆ With a passion for solving puzzles and working with numbers, I love building with data. With projects spanning recommendation systems, time series forecasting and large language models, I have worked extensively with data science.

ðŸš€ My professional journey includes OCBC, where I led several projects driving revenue with machine learning, and JP Morgan Chase, where I introduced data science to optimize workflows beyong my scope of a server side developer.

ðŸŽ“ Equipped with a Master's in Machine Learning and a Bachelor's in Computer Science (with a minor of Finance and French), I've earned several accolades, including university scholarships and Dean's Honour Lists.

ðŸ¤– When I'm not diving into data, you'll find me exploring trivia, linguistics, art history, puzzles, and learning the guitar.
