## About
Hello, I'm Shubhankar Agrawal!

Data Scientist | Problem Solver | AI Enthusiast

ðŸŒŸ Turning Data into Insights, and Insights into Impact! ðŸŒŸ

ðŸ“ˆ With a passion for crunching numbers and a knack for solving complex puzzles, I'm your go-to data wizard. From optimizing marketing campaigns for leading banks to crafting trading strategies for the crypto-savvy, I've left no data unturned.

ðŸš€ My journey includes stints at OCBC where I boosted revenue, and at JP Morgan Chase where I wielded both code and creativity. I've even conquered the world of cryptocurrency with mathematical models.

ðŸŽ“ Armed with a Master's in Artificial Intelligence and a Bachelor's in Computer Science (with a touch of Finance and French), I've been recognized for my achievements, including the prestigious OCBC AI Scholarship.

ðŸ¤– When I'm not diving into data, you'll find me exploring the realms of trivia, linguistics, art history, and strumming some tunes on my ukulele. I'm not just about data; I'm all about balance!

Let's explore the world of data and creativity together. Feel free to connect with me, and together, we can weave magic!
